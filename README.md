
This is a redesigned Amazon clone built with HTML, Tailwind CSS, and JavaScript. It uses the Firestore Database and is hosted on Firebase.

Inspired by this concept design on Dribbble.

It is currently not responsive. Please view it on desktop.

The Firebase init files are not pushed to the repository, so private information does not get leaked.

If the items are not showing on Chrome, try a different browser.
